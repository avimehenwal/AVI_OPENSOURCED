Round-robin scheduling
------------------------------

Time slices (quantum) are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority (also known as cyclic executive)
 
Round Robin algorithm is a pre-emptive algorithm as the scheduler forces the process out of the CPU once the time quota expires.

starvation-free.
such as data packet scheduling in computer networks

A scheduler is a preemptive scheduler if it has the ability to get invoked by an interrupt and move a process out of a running state to let another process run.
If a scheduler cannot take the CPU away from a process then it is a cooperative, or non-preemptive scheduler. Old operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 3.1 or Apple MacOS prior to OS X are examples of cooperative schedulers.

race condition
--------------------------

A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence in order to be done correctly.
