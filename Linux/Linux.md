Linux Kernel
------------------

In computing, the kernel is a computer program that manages I/O (input/output) requests from software, and translates them into data processing instructions for the central processing unit and other electronic components of a computer.

Because of its critical nature, the kernel code is usually loaded into a protected area of memory, which prevents it from being overwritten by other, less frequently used parts of the operating system or by application programs.

When a computer program (in this context called a process) makes requests of the kernel, the request is called a system call.

### Functions of the kernel :

1. CPU Scheduling
2. Memory Management
3. I/O Devices Management
4. System Calls
